# Surviving-the-Titanic
A Machine Learning Model

This Notebook contains a practical use case for predictive analysis which involves:

- Building Machine Learning models
- Using proper computational algorithms to derive insights from real-life historical Data
- Also Involves an interactive session where we answer the question - Would you have survived the Titanic?
- Lastly, Some key graphs on survivor demographics
